# If-Elif-Else statements

## Task

Follow these steps:
1. Create a new Python file called age-quiz.py. The program you create in this file will be used to output a variety of responses determined by the data the user enters.
2. If the user is 40 or over, output the message "You're over the hill."
3. Write code to take in a userâ€™s age and store it in an integer variable called
age.
4. Assume that the oldest someone can be is 100; if the user enters a higher number, output the message "Sorry, you're dead.".
5. If the user is 65 or older, output the message "Enjoy your retirement!"
6. If the user is under 13, output the message "You qualify for the kiddie
discount."
7. If the user is 21, output the message "Congrats on your 21st!"
8. For any other age, output the message "Age is but a number."

### Tips:
 - You should use the if-elif-else statement structure to create the program.
 - Note that the order in which you set up the conditions is important; you will need to work out what makes sense in terms of the logical tests applied to the ages.
